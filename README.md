# Theory of Computing

Several example problems in theory of computing.

## epsilon-NFA
`SimEnka.py` contains the code for nondeterministic finite automaton with epsilon transitions.

## DFA minimization
`MinDka.py` contains the code for minimization of deterministic finite automaton.

## Pushdown automaton simulator
`SimPa.py` contains the code for the pushdown automaton simulator.

## Recursive descent parser
`Parser.py` contains the code for the recursive descent parser.
